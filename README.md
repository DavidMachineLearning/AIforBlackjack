# AI for Blackjack
In this repository I have implemented some Monte Carlo algorithms (Reinforcement Learning) from scratch in order to teach an agent how to play Blackjack.
The agent will learn the best action to take (Hit or Stick) according to the actual configuration of the game.

Informations about the environment can be found here:

### Requirements:
- Python3.6
- numpy (1.15.4)
- gim   (0.10.9)
- matplotlib (3.0.1)

### Files:
- plot_utils.py (functions for data visualization)
- Blackjack.jpnb (jupyter notebook)
- report.pdf (pdf version of the jupyter notebook)
